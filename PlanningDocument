TO DO: 

Design product (see above)

Code the project!

If it's a website, register a domain

Deploy the project to said domain or at least figure out how we *would* host it

Create demo video with:

  A) Screencaptures of the working product (as much as works!)
  B) Voiceover and/or text talking about features and our process and what we learned
  
Questions we need to answer for the judges:

Did the hack address a clearly defined problem space that benefited from this development? 
Did your team explore a new application domain (e.g. conservation, education, etc.) with which you weren’t previously familiar?
How relevant and creative was your project in solving an issue within the track you chose to follow?
What technologies did your team leverage? Did your team try to learn a new technology?
Was your team methodical and collaborative in your hacking process? Did your team overcome any obstacles or major goal changes during hacking?
Did your team put thought into the user experience? What accessibility considerations did you make?
